## Overview

this is a project that i made using the designs of frontend challenges
it is a multiple page site in which i used [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) (the routing
is done using HashRouter and not the BrowserRouter because there is
no backend server to solve the sub-url bug). i used [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/) for the
sliders and [ToastifyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/toastify-js?activeTab=readme) for the notifications, i also used [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for
the styling of the page. there's also an email validation where an error
notification will show if the field is empty or has an invalid format.
